The area of ​​analysis for this project is the application of big data analytics in prediction
heart failure. This involves the use of large data sets, including records
health electronics, medical imaging, genomic data and lifestyle information,
to develop predictive models. By integrating and analyzing these various data sources,
we can uncover patterns and risk factors associated with heart failure, leading to predictions
more accurate and to better informed clinical decisions.
